## Steps of React

1. Render out hard-coded data
2. Model your data (similar to the process in Rails)
3. Add state to your app
4. Make render use app's state (remove hard-coding from render)
5. Handle events from interactive elements ('onClick', 'onChange')
6. Connect those methods that update the app's state ('this.setState')

## Models

### User 
- firstName
- lastName
- profileImage
